# Welcome to the Ramadan League Data Science Competition!

We are excited to have you participate in this challenge. The competition is divided into five problems, each designed to test your skills in different aspects of data science.

## Competition Structure

### Problems:
1. [**Architectural Marvel** (10%)](./1.%20Architectural%20Marvel/)  
2. [**Try Solve Me** (15%)](./Try%20Solve%20Me/)  
3. [**Code Breaker** (15%)](./3.%20Code%20Breaker/)  
4. [**Taxi Time Challenge** (30%)](./4.%20Taxi%20Time%20Challenge/)  
5. [**Sentiment Sleuth** (30%)](./5.%20Sentiment%20Sleuth/)  

### Scoring System

Your score will be calculated as follows:

```math
\text{score} = \text{weight}_{\text{INE}} \times \sum (\text{weight}_{\text{problem}} \times \frac{\text{score}_{\text{problem}}}{100})
```

Where:
- **$\text{score}_{\text{problem}}$**: The score you earn for each problem, ranging from 0 to 100.
- **$\text{weight}_{\text{problem}}$**: The weight assigned to each problem as listed above.
- **$\text{weight}_{\text{INE}}$**: A factor based on your INE year:
  - **INE3**: 0.7
  - **INE2**: 0.8
  - **INE1**: 1
  - For teams with members from multiple years, the $\text{weight}_{\text{INE}}$ will be the average.

## Code Documentation Requirements

Please ensure that every line of code is well documented and explained. Failure to do so may result in a loss of points.
